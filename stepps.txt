logging
  user log in global scope, logged into by handlers
  app log closed in app, logged into by itself
  should they be more linked?
    this can be done in the handler if they like
    thinks not
      should be able to freely use app from console or ui
      inspecting each log separately


* don't require components for this one
    or rather, make it clear the important steps are 1 & 2
  keep it to simple html & handlers
  focus on using the app + log
  and differentiating between user & app logs

get rid of consolemd
  all logs traceback to the same line of their source
  instead learn how to do css(?) in console messages
